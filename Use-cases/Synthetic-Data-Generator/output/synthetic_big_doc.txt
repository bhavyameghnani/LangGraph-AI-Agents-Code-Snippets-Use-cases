It was a remarkable quarter—and demand for Innovex Cloud Infrastructure continues to build.  Over the next…

Section 4:

Backlog increased by 387% to $422 billion.  This was a remarkable quarter, and demand for Xylos Cloud Infrastructure continues to surge.  Over the next few months, we anticipate securing several additional multi-billion-dollar customer agreements, and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are projected to surpass $510 billion. The scale of our recent RPO growth allows for a significant upward revision to the Cloud Infrastructure segment of Xylos Corporation's overall financial forecast, which will be presented comprehensively next month at the Investor Relations Meeting.  As a preview, we project Xylos Cloud Infrastructure revenue to increase by 72% to $17.5 billion this fiscal year—followed by growth to $30 billion, $68 billion, $109 billion, and $137 billion over the subsequent four years.  The majority of the revenue projected within this five-year forecast is already reflected in our reported RPO. Xylos is experiencing a strong start to FY27.

“MultiCloud database revenue from AzureSphere, Nimbus Computing, and Zenith Cloud grew at an exceptional rate of 1,485% in Q1,” stated Xylos Chairman and CTO,  Johnathan Davies. “We expect MultiCloud revenue to exhibit substantial growth each quarter for several years as we deploy an additional 35 datacenters to our three hyperscaler partners, bringing the total to 68.  And next month at Xylos Cloud Summit, we will unveil a new Cloud Infrastructure service, the ‘Xylos AI Database,’ enabling our customers to utilize the Large Language Model of their preference—including  Perseus AI,  AetherMind, and  NovaLang—directly integrated with the Xylos Database for seamless access and analysis of existing database data. This innovative cloud service empowers our tens of thousands of database clients to instantly unlock the value within their data by providing easy access to leading-edge AI reasoning models. Xylos AI Cloud Infrastructure and the Xylos MultiCloud AI Database will both contribute to a dramatic increase in cloud demand and consumption in the coming years. AI is Transforming Everything.”

(4) Estimated future annual amortization expense related to intangible assets as of October 31, 2025, is as follows:

Remainder of fiscal 2026  $1,872
Fiscal 2027                 $1,035
Fiscal 2028                 $988
Fiscal 2029                 $891
Fiscal 2030                 $815
Fiscal 2031                 $507
Thereafter                  $349
Total Intangible Assets, Net $6,457

Section 10:

Remainder of fiscal 2026	$873
Fiscal 2027	$489
Fiscal 2028	$462
Fiscal 2029	$408
Fiscal 2030	$381
Fiscal 2031	$241
Thereafter	$167
Total intangible assets, net	$2,521

(5) Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective GAAP tax rate of 13.2% and 8.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively, and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 19.7% and 17.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition-related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the impact of the  Innovation and Growth Act (refer to Appendix A for additional information), and net deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition-related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.

Section 13: Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(1) To supplement our statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we utilize non-GAAP measures of cash flow on a trailing four-quarter basis to assess cash flow generated from operating activities.  We believe that free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, provides a useful benchmark for comparing our performance against competitors.  The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income as an indicator of our overall performance, nor should it be considered a replacement for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

Q1 Fiscal 2027 Financial Results
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude certain business…

Section 15:

**Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures**

To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures as detailed in the accompanying tables.  These measures exclude specific items, including charges related to business combinations and associated acquisition expenses, as well as stock-based compensation expense. We believe these exclusions are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and in forecasting future results.  It is important to note that our non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures.  They should be considered only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our management team regularly uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally for operational decision-making, business management, and performance evaluation. These non-GAAP measures are key factors considered in our planning and forecasting processes for future periods.  A portion of our executive compensation is tied to the company's performance as measured by these non-GAAP metrics.  The non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for the following items, and the related income tax effects (except for the impact of the provisions of the  "Accelerated Growth and Investment Act"):

*   **Stock-Based Compensation Expense:** The effect of stock-based compensation expense has been excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax expense, and net income. While stock-based compensation is a critical component of our employee incentive programs, and we believe it has materially contributed to revenue generation in past periods and will continue to do so in future periods, we believe evaluating our business performance excluding this expense provides valuable insights.  We anticipate ongoing stock-based compensation expense in future periods.  The exclusion of this expense is consistent with the practices of many companies in our industry.

Section 16: Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of our core operating performance, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures.  These measures exclude the impact of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating results.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in Appendix A.

• Stock-Based Compensation: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects, and net income measures.  Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item and its impact can vary significantly from period to period depending on factors such as share price volatility and the vesting of stock options.  Stock-based compensation expense is expected to continue in future periods.

• Amortization of Intangible Assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects, and net income measures. The amount and timing of amortization of intangible assets are inherently unpredictable and are significantly influenced by the nature and timing of acquisitions.  The amortization expense reflects the allocation of the cost of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Investors should note that the acquired intangible assets contributed to revenues during the periods presented and are expected to continue contributing to future revenue. Amortization of intangible assets is expected to recur in future periods.

• Acquisition-Related and Other Expenses; and Restructuring Expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition-related and other expenses, and restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects, and net income measures.  These expenses are associated with acquisitions completed during the periods presented, and include expenses related to integrating acquired businesses and implementing strategic initiatives. Acquisition-related expenses included professional fees, integration costs, and employee-related expenses.  Restructuring expenses primarily consisted of employee severance payments and facility closure costs associated with streamlining operations.  While the magnitude of these expenses may vary from period to period, we expect to incur similar expenses in connection with future acquisitions and strategic initiatives. We believe that presenting these measures enhances investor understanding of our underlying operating performance.

Section 17:  Significant Transactions and Other Matters

In connection with potential future acquisitions and strategic initiatives, the Company anticipates incurring various expenses, including but not limited to transaction advisory fees, legal and accounting costs, and integration expenses.  The nature and magnitude of such expenses will depend on the specific circumstances of each transaction.


• Impact of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Act of 2025 (CTRA): The CTRA was enacted on August 15, 2025.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $785 million, primarily attributable to the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability originally established in fiscal year 2021. This remeasurement resulted from the Company's restructuring of its international subsidiaries, completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.  The impact of this one-time charge has been excluded from the Company's non-GAAP measures of income tax expense and net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.  The Company believes that this exclusion provides a more accurate reflection of its underlying operating performance and facilitates meaningful comparison to prior periods.  The Company is confident that its adjusted non-GAAP metrics reflect the ongoing operational strength of the business, independent of this non-recurring tax impact.
