AUSTIN, Texas, September 9, 2025 -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2026 Q1 results. Total Remaining Performance
Obligations were up 359% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency to $455 billion. Total quarterly revenues were up 12% in USD, and up
11% in constant currency to $14.9 billion. Cloud revenues were up 28% in USD, and up 27% in constant currency to $7.2 billion. Software revenues
were down 1% in USD, and down 2% in constant currency to $5.7 billion.
Q1 GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year in USD and up 7% in constant
currency. GAAP net income was $2.9 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $4.3 billion, up 8% in USD and up 6% in constant currency. Q1 GAAP earnings
per share was $1.01, down 2% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 6% in USD and up 4% in
constant currency.
Short-term deferred revenues were $12.1 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow was $21.5 billion, up 13% in USD.
“We signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “This resulted in RPO contract
backlog increasing 359% to $455 billion. It was an astonishing quarter—and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build. Over the next
few months, we expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars. The scale of our
recent RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to the Cloud Infrastructure portion of Oracle’s overall financial plan which we will be
presenting in detail next month at the Financial Analyst Meeting. As a bit of a preview, we expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to
$18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years. Most of the
revenue in this 5-year forecast is already booked in our reported RPO. Oracle is off to a brilliant start to FY26.”
“MultiCloud database revenue from Amazon, Google and Microsoft grew at the incredible rate of 1,529% in Q1,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO,
Larry Ellison. “We expect MultiCloud revenue to grow substantially every quarter for several years as we deliver another 37 datacenters to our three
Hyperscaler partners, for a total of 71. And next month at Oracle AI World, we will introduce a new Cloud Infrastructure service called the ‘Oracle AI
Database’ that enables our customers to use the Large Language Model of their choice—including Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, xAI’s Grok, etc.
—directly on top of the Oracle Database to easily access and analyze all their existing database data. This revolutionary new cloud service enables the
tens of thousands of our database customers to instantly unlock the value in their data by making it easily accessible to the most advanced AI
reasoning models. Oracle AI Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle MultiCloud AI Database will both contribute to dramatically increasing cloud demand
and consumption over the next several years. AI Changes Everything.”
The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders
of record as of the close of business on October 9, 2025, with a payment date of October 23, 2025.

(1) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information
to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this
information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States
dollars at the exchange rates in effect on May 31, 2025, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the
respective periods. Movements in international currencies relative to the United States dollar during the three months ended August 31, 2025 compared with
the corresponding prior year period increased our total revenues by 1 percentage point and operating income by 3 percentage points.
(2) Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 includes the impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law on July 4, 2025.

(1) This presentation includes non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures,
and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a detailed explanation of the adjustments
made to comparable GAAP measures, the reasons why management uses these measures, the usefulness of these measures and the material limitations on the
usefulness of these measures, please see Appendix A.
(2) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to
provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information,
current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange
rates in effect on May 31, 2025, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.
(3) Stock-based compensation was included in the following GAAP operating expense categories:

Remainder of fiscal 2026 $ 1,219

Fiscal 2028 635
Fiscal 2029 561
Fiscal 2030 522

Total intangible assets, net $ 4,167
(5) Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective GAAP tax rate of 14.6% and 7.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively, and an effective nonGAAP tax rate of 20.5% and 18.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal
2026 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization
of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (refer to Appendix A for additional information), and net
deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure. The difference in our GAAP
and non-GAAP tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition related and
other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income
tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.

presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as
an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

(1) The sum of the quarterly information presented may vary from the year-to-date information presented due to rounding.
(2) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to
provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information,
current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange
rates in effect on May 31, 2025 and 2024 for the fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025 constant currency growth rate calculations presented, respectively, rather than the actual
exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.

APPENDIX A
ORACLE CORPORATION
Q1 FISCAL 2026 FINANCIAL RESULTS
EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude certain business
combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including stock-based compensation, that we
believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our
business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future
periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial
measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects related to each of the below items except for the impact
of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act:
• Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income
tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation
contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue
to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.
• Amortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax
effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size
of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will
contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.
• Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of
restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our
acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as
a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel-related costs for transitional and certain other employees,
certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.
Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on
our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past
acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic
initiatives.
• Impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA): OBBBA was signed into law on July 4, 2025. We recorded a net tax expense of $958 million during the first
quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily related to the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability previously recorded during fiscal 2021, as part of the partial
realignment of our legal entity structure. We have excluded the impact of this charge from our non-GAAP income taxes and net income measures in the first
quarter of fiscal 2026. We believe making these adjustments provides insight to our operating performance and comparability to past operating results.
